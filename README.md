This is a sample website written in JavaScript utilizing the Kentico Kontent Delivery API to manage and retrieve content. You can register your account for free at <https://app.kontent.ai>. For a brief walkthrough, read [Running the React sample app](https://docs.kontent.ai/tutorials/develop-apps/get-started/running-a-sample-application?tech=react) on our Developer Hub.

It includes Shopify integration sample using data from [Shopify Product selector](https://github.com/Kentico/cloud-custom-element-sample-shopify).

## Application setup

1. Install the latest version of NodeJS and npm. You can download both at <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>.
2. Clone the sample application repository.
3. Navigate to the root folder of the application in the command line.
4. Type `npm install` to install required npm packages.
5. Type `npm start` to start a development server.
6. The application opens in your browser at <http://localhost:3000>.

After starting, the sample application retrieves content from the **default** Kentico Kontent sample project.

### Connecting to your sample project

At the first run of the app, you'll be presented with a configuration page. It will allow you to connect the app to your Kentico Kontent project or create a new one. You'll also be able to start a trial and convert to a free plan when the trial expires.

Alternatively, you can connect your project manually as per the chapter below.

#### Connecting to your project manually

If you want to change the source Kentico Kontent project, follow these steps:

1. In Kentico Kontent, choose Project settings from the app menu.
2. Under Development, choose API keys.
3. Copy your Project ID
4. Open the [`src\Client.js`](/src/Client.js) file in the sample application folder.
5. Find the `projectId` constant.
6. Change the values of the constant using the Project ID key you copied.
7. Save the file.

When you now run the sample application, the application retrieves content from your project.

## Previewing content from your project

If you already have a Kentico Kontent account and you want to connect the sample application to a project of your own, you need to provide your Project ID and your Preview API key to authorize requests to the Delivery Preview API. For example, you can connect the application to your modified version of the sample project.

To preview content in the sample application, follow these steps:

1. In Kentico Kontent, choose Project settings from the app menu.
2. Under Development, choose API keys.
3. Copy your Project ID and Preview API key.
4. Open the `src\Client.js` file in the sample application folder.
5. Find the `projectId` and `previewApiKey` constants.
6. Change the values of the constants using the Project ID and Preview API key you copied.
7. Save the file.

When you now run the application, you will see all project content including the unpublished version of content items.

## Content administration

1. Navigate to <https://app.kontent.ai> in your browser.
2. Sign in with your credentials.
3. Manage content in the content administration interface of your sample project.

You can learn more about content editing with Kentico Kontent in the [documentation](https://docs.kontent.ai/).

## Content delivery

You can retrieve content either through the Kentico Kontent Delivery SDKs or the Kentico Kontent Delivery API:

* For published content, use `https://deliver.kontent.ai/PROJECT_ID/items`.
* For unpublished content, use `https://preview-deliver.kontent.ai/PROJECT_ID/items`.

For more info about the API, see the [API reference](https://developer.kontent.ai/reference).

You can find the Delivery and other SDKs at <https://github.com/Kentico>.
